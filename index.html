<h2>What is Abilify?</h2>

    <p>Abilify is an antipsychotic drug that is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and it is also widely prescribed as an add-on treatment for depression.</p>

    <p>Abilify is thought to regulate dopamine, the neurotransmitter that activates the reward pathway in the brain.</p>

<h2> What is the Abilify lawsuit about?</h2>

    <p>Some Abilify users have reported uncontrollable urges to gamble.</p>

    <p>In 2012 and 2015 respectively, regulatory agencies in Europe and Canada warned that Abilify use is linked to an increased risk of compulsive gambling.</p>

    <p>However, the U.S. product label failed to warn doctors and patients about the potential risks until early 2016.</p>

<h2>Do I have a case?</h2>

    <p>If you developed a serious gambling problem while taking Abilify, you may have a claim for compensation.</p>

    <p>Zimmerman Reed is investigating the claims of individuals who accrued at least $20,000 in gambling losses while taking Abilify.</p>

<h2>Will my case be part of a class action?</h2>

    <p> No. If a case is filed on your behalf, it will most likely be part of a multi-district litigation, or MDL.</p>

    <p>When several cases are filed by people who were similarly harmed by a product, the pending cases may be consolidated to ensure efficiency of pre-trial proceedings.</p>

    <p>However, unlike class actions, cases filed in an MDL remain separate lawsuits, and plaintiffs' claims are resolved on an individual basis.</p>

<h2>Will my case go to trial?</h2>

    <p>Given the large pool of cases in this type of litigation, it is unlikely that your case would be selected to go to trial.</p>

<h2>How much does it cost to retain a lawyer?</h2>

    <p>Zimmerman Reed works on a contingent basis, which means there is no out-of-pocket cost to you.</p>

    <p>Zimmerman Reed's standard fees amount to 33 1/3% of any recovery plus costs advanced.</p>

<h2>How long will it take to resolve my case?</h2>

    <p>Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing. These types of cases often last many years.</p>

<h2>Should I stop taking Abilify?</h2>

    <p>Do not stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor first.</p>
