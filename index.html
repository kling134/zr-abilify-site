<h1>Abilify Lawsuit</h1>

<h2>What is Abilify?</h2>
    <p>Abilify is an antipsychotic drug that is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and it is also widely prescribed as an add-on treatment for depression.</p>
    <p>Abilify regulates dopamine, the neurotransmitter that activates the reward pathway in the brain.</p>

<h2>What is the Abilify lawsuit about?</h2>
    <p>Some Abilify users have reported uncontrollable urges to gamble.</p>
    <p>In 2012 and 2015 respectively, regulatory agencies in Europe and Canada warned that Abilify use is linked to an increased risk of compulsive gambling. However, the U.S. product label failed to warn doctors and patients about the potential risks until early 2016.</p>

<h2>Do I have a case?</h2>
    <p>If you developed a serious gambling problem while taking Abilify, you may be eligible for compensation. Zimmerman Reed is investigating the claims of individuals who accrued at least $20,000 in gambling losses while taking Abilify.</p>

<h2>Will my case be part of a class action?</h2>
    <p>No. If a case is filed on your behalf, it will most likely be part of a multi-district litigation, or MDL. When many cases are filed by people who were similarly harmed by a product, the pending cases may be consolidated in an MDL to ensure efficiency of pre-trial proceedings. However, unlike class actions, cases filed in an MDL remain separate lawsuits, and plaintiffs' claims are resolved on an individual basis.</p>

<h2>Will my case go to trial?</h2>
    <p>Given the large pool of cases in this type of litigation, it is unlikely that your case would be selected to go to trial.</p>

<h2>How much does it cost to retain a lawyer?</h2>
    <p>Zimmerman Reed works on a contingent basis, which means there is no out-of-pocket cost to you. Zimmerman Reed's standard fees amount to 33 1/3% of any recovery plus costs advanced.</p>

<h2>How long will it take to resolve my case?</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing. These types of cases often last many years.</p>

<h2>Should I stop taking Abilify?</h2>
    <p>Do not stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor.</p>
